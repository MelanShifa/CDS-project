# CDS Project
Repository for the CDS Project Team S23

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to develop a full stack web application for identifying, tracking, and visualizing prerequisites, co-requisites, and other requisites within the Universityâ€™s academic programs. 

### Project Scope
The primary scope of this project is locally within the confines of Minnesota State University, Mankato. Specifically, within the Curriculum Design System. It will mainly be used internally by students and faculty advisors. The focus of this project is implementing a technical solution for a design using Directed Acyclic Graph to depict a single college course and all related prerequisite and corequisite courses.

### Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to visualize the course maps that students follow to receive a degree and decrease their chances of dropping out. Visualization would also help faculty advisors guide their advisees more efficiently.  

In order for this project to be considered successful, the deliverables to be accomplished are the following: 

  * Establish a RAD (Requirements Analysis Document) approved by the client 

  * Write User Stories that capture and span intended use cases and requirements 

  * Do a data Analysis and Cleansing in order to be used as the basis for first release of application 

  * Establish a wireframe Mockup of the UI (User Interface) and the UX (User Experience) 

  * Design document for the application Front End  

  * Establish the test document for full stack application  

  * Worked on a full stack application (Front end) 
  
## Tools and Technology
The backend parsing algorithm was developed in Python.
  
Sigma.js was chosen as the visualization framework as it is javascript-based and a free tool specialized for developing graphs with nodes and edges.
  
## How to run
To build the code:
 - Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 - Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
 - Install [gjslint](https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto?hl=en).
 - Use `npm install` to install sigma development dependencies.
 - Use `npm run build` to minify the code with [Uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS). The minified file `sigma.min.js` will then be accessible in the `build/` folder.
